\subsection*{Topic}

VPP (Vector Packet Processing) \cite{vppwiki:1} is an open source software for
providing efficient network switching and routing.
In contrary to common hardware switches, the whole packet processing is done in
software. This allows a more versatile use of the same router in different
applications and provides flexibility regarding hardware it can run on.

Typically hardware router are expected to be faster than software router, but
VPP has several approaches to perform better compared to similar software
projects like Open vSwitch or the Linux Router: As the name indicates, it
processes packages in vectors, in other words, multiple packages at a time which
reduces overhead per package. Furthermore it uses an own driver for it's network
interfaces.

The scope of this Bachelor's thesis shall be to measure the performance of VPP
and to evaluate which scenarios are important to be tested.


\subsection*{Approach}

Fist of all this Bachelor's Thesis shall explain, why the below stated scenarios
have been selected to measure the performance of VPP. Afterwards automated tests
shall be implemented to run the scenarios on the Baltikum testbed. In the end a
conclusion shall be made, giving VPP a rough rank relative to real world routing
solutions.

This Bachelor's Thesis shall test VPP torwards IPv4 versus IPv6,
packet sizes, cpu scaling (optionally multi socket NUMA architectures) and
routing table sizes (BGP table size \textgreater 600.000 entries in 2017 \cite{bgphelp:1}).
Optionally one specific VPP feature like tunneling, firewall or NAT can be analyzed, too.

Measurement results shall contain package count (per time), latency, package loss and whitebox testing results: cpu load and cache misses.
