%
% USAGE
%   \TUMlogo{key=value}
%   \EIlogo{key=value}
%   \MSVlogo{key=value}
%          Draw the TUM/EI/MSV logo with options
%             height = <dimen> (default 1cm)
%                        (EIlogo actually occupies 105% of height!)
%             color  = <colorname> (default color is TUMBlue)
%             white  = <colorname> (default color is TUMWhite)
%          Only applicable to TUMLogo
%             shape  = filled/outline (default is filled)
%             filled = true/false (shortcut for shape=filled)
%             outline = true/false (shortcut for shape=outline)
