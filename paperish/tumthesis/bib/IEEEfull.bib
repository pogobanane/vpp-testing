USAGE:

\bibliographystyle{mybstfile}
\bibliography{IEEEfull,mybibfile}

where the IEEE titles in the .bib database entries use the strings
defined here. e.g.,


   journal = IEEE_J_AC,


to yield "{\sc{IEEE}} Transactions on Automatic Control"


WARNING: The IEEE uses abbreviated journal titles in their bibliographies!
Because this file provides the full titles, you should NOT use this file
for work that is to be submitted to the IEEE.

For IEEE work, you should use the abbreviated titles provided in the
companion file, IEEEabrv.bib.


** NOTES **

 1. Journals have been grouped according to subject in order to make it
    easier to locate and extract the definitions for related journals - 
    as most works use references that are confined to a single topic.
    Magazines are listed in straight alphabetical order.

 2. String names are closely based on IEEE's own internal acronyms.

 3. Older, out-of-print IEEE titles are included (but not including titles
    dating prior to the IEEE's formation from the IRE and AIEE in 1963).
