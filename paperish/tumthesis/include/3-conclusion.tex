\chapter{Conclusion}

FastClick and \Ac{vpp} both vectorize packet in their processing and
are the most direct competitors for each other performancewise.
\Ac{vpp} v18.10 is a little faster with smaller routing tables while
it's routing table implementation is clearly not suited for huge
table sizes.
