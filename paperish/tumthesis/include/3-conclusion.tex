\chapter{Conclusion}

FastClick and \Ac{vpp} both vectorize packet in their processing and
are the most direct competitors for each other performancewise.
\Ac{vpp} v18.10 is a little faster with smaller routing tables while
it's routing table implementation is clearly not suited for huge
table sizes. % be more precise, say size numbers

Next steps / low hangin fruit: futher steps to carry my research to Kappa

- virtualization scenarios: running vpp in containers?, benchmarking virtualized systems?, benchmarking virtual link interfaces


performance decrease in vpp over time

live inserts super good because of multithreaded model

vpp as full grown software router with many features, fully modular processing graph which can be adjusted at runtime
