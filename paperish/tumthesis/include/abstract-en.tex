With high performance, low level network packet processing frameworks
like DPDK, software routers can reach throughput speeds almost
saturating 10GbE links with minimum sized packets using a single CPU
core. This paper analyzes how \Ac{vpp} can reach its high packet
throughput rates and describes possible bottlenecks. Tests are
conducted to show that the CPU is a bottleneck with 10GbE networking.
Especially different \Ac{fib} sizes are tested to find out whether
\Ac{vpp} is capable of routing the Internet. In the process, aspects
of \Ac{vpp}'s behavior with big routing tables are modeled. In the
final comparison \Ac{vpp} performs well with little routes, but has
less throughput than its competitors with big routing tables.
