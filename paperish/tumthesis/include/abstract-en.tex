With high performance, low level network packet processing frameworks
like DPDK, software routers can reach throughput speeds almost
saturating 10GbE links with minimum sized packets using a single CPU
core. Examples for this are open source projects like \Ac{vpp},
FastClick or MoonRoute. This paper analyzes how \Ac{vpp} can reach
it's high packet throughput rates and describes possible bottlenecks.
Tests to measure it's performance measurements are conducted and
explained in detail. Results are presented for layer 2, \Ac{ip4},
\Ac{ip6} and \Ac{vxlan} encapsulation scenarios. Especially different
\Ac{fib} sizes are tested to find out whether \Ac{vpp} is capable of
routing the internet. Forwarding latencies are analyzed and a brief
comparison to other software routers will be made. Furthermore many
measurement results are explained by creating models.
