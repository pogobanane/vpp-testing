        transmission and compression of information in general multisource
        multicast networks. Network nodes independently and randomly select
        linear mappings from inputs onto output links over some field. We
        show that this achieves capacity with probability exponentially approaching
        1 with the code length. We also demonstrate that random linear coding
        performs compression when necessary in a network, generalizing error
        exponents for linear Slepian-Wolf coding in a natural way. Benefits
        of this approach are decentralized operation and robustness to network
        changes or link failures. We show that this approach can take advantage
        of redundant network capacity for improved success probability and
       robustness. We illustrate some potential advantages of random linear
        network coding over routing in two examples of practical scenarios:
        distributed network operation and networks with dynamically varying
        connections. Our derivation of these results also yields a new bound
        on required field size for centralized network coding on general
        multicast networks},

        over coded packet networks, i.e., packet networks where the contents
        of outgoing packets are arbitrary, causal functions of the contents
        of received packets. We consider both wireline and wireless packet
        networks as well as both static multicast (where membership of the
        multicast group remains constant for the duration of the connection)
        and dynamic multicast (where membership of the multicast group changes
        in time, with nodes joining and leaving the group). For static multicast,
        we reduce the problem to a polynomial-time solvable optimization
        problem, and we present decentralized algorithms for solving it.
        These algorithms, when coupled with existing decentralized schemes
        for constructing network codes, yield a fully decentralized approach
        for achieving minimum-cost multicast. By contrast, establishing minimum-cost
        static multicast connections over routed packet networks is a very
        difficult problem even using centralized computation, except in the
        special cases of unicast and broadcast connections. For dynamic multicast,
        we reduce the problem to a dynamic programming problem and apply
        the theory of dynamic programming to suggest how it may be solved.},

        considered. The dependency among the servers is described by the
        definition of their subsets that can be activated simultaneously.
        Multihop radio networks provide a motivation for the consideration
        of this system. The problem of scheduling the server activation under
        the constraints imposed by the dependency among servers is studied.
        The performance criterion of a scheduling policy is its throughput
        that is characterized by its stability region, that is, the set of
        vectors of arrival and service rates for which the system is stable.
        A policy is obtained which is optimal in the sense that its stability
        region is a superset of the stability region of every other scheduling
        policy, and this stability region is characterized. The behavior
        of the network is studied for arrival rates that lie outside the
        stability region. Implications of the results in certain types of

        communication network on which a number of information sources are
        to be multicast to certain sets of destinations. We assume that the
        information sources are mutually independent. The problem is to characterize
        the admissible coding rate region. This model subsumes all previously
        studied models along the same line. We study the problem with one
        information source, and we have obtained a simple characterization
        of the admissible coding rate region. Our result can be regarded
        as the max-flow min-cut theorem for network information flow. Contrary
        to one's intuition, our work reveals that it is in general not optimal
        to regard the information to be multicast as a “fluid” which can
        simply be routed or replicated. Rather, by employing coding at the
        nodes, which we refer to as network coding, bandwidth can in general
        be saved. This finding may have significant impact on future design
        of switching systems},

title = {Scheduling for Network Coded Multicast: A Conflict Graph Formulation},
abstract = {Consider network coded multicast traffic over a wireless network in the bandwidth limited regime. We formulate the joint medium access and subgraph optimization problem by means of a graphical conflict model. The nature of network coded flows is not captured by classical link-based scheduling and therefore requires a novel approach based on conflicting hyperarcs. By means of simulations, we evaluate the performance of our algorithm and conclude that it significantly outperforms existing scheduling techniques.},

  abstract = {The problem of multiple multicast sessions with intra-session network
        coding in time-varying networks is considered. The network-layer
        capacity region of input rates that can be stably supported is established.
        Dynamic algorithms for multicast routing, network coding, power allocation,
        session scheduling, and rate allocation across correlated sources,
        which achieve stability for rates within the capacity region, are
        presented. This work builds on the back-pressure approach introduced
        by Tassiulas , extending it to network coding and correlated sources.
        In the proposed algorithms, decisions on routing, network coding,
        and scheduling between different sessions at a node are made locally
        at each node based on virtual queues for different sinks. For correlated
        sources, the sinks locally determine and control transmission rates
        across the sources. The proposed approach yields a completely distributed
        algorithm for wired networks. In the wireless case, power control
        among different transmitters is centralized while routing, network
        coding, and scheduling between different sessions at a given node
        are distributed.},

        reliability. Each packet transmission can be overheard by a subset
        of receiver nodes, with a transmission success probability that may
        vary from receiver to receiver and may also vary with time. We develop
        a simple backpressure routing algorithm that maximizes network throughput
        and expends an average power that can be pushed arbitrarily close
        to the minimum average power required for network stability, with
        a corresponding tradeoff in network delay. When channels are orthogonal,
        the algorithm can be implemented in a distributed manner using only
        local link error probability information, and supports a #blind##transmission#
        mode (where error probabilities are not required) in special cases
        when the power metric is neglected and when there is only a single
