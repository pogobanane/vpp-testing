=========

LaTeX template for talks and lectures. The most important things are documented
below:


Dependencies
------------

In order to compile the template you need the following packages:
    texlive-full >= 2015
    make

For markdown support (optional) you additionally need:
    pandoc

Tested under Linux (Debian) and OSX only.


Usage
-----

The template is ready to use for short talks on conferences or seminars. In
case larger presentations such as lectures are planned, use the class option
'lecture', which differs in the following points:

1) Font size is decreased.

2) Headline changes and displays section titles instead of the TUM banner to
   make more room for content.

3) Footer changes and displays the current section/subsection.


Class options
-------------

english/german  - set language
lecture         - enable lecture mode
beameralt       - enables alternate beamer mode similar to lecture mode but
                  suited for normal presentations
noframenumbers  - disables frame numbers
notitleframe    - disables titleframe
nocontentsframe - suppresses automatic generation of contentframes after new
                  parts/sections


Command reference

Known bugs:
-----------

- Frame breaks in TOCs are suboptimal (affects primarily lecture mode)
